Fyyur
-----

### Introduction

Fyyur is a musical venue and artist booking site that facilitates the discovery and bookings of shows between local performing artists and venues. This site lets you list new artists and venues, discover them, and list shows with artists as a venue owner.

My job was to build out the data models to power the API endpoints for the Fyyur site by connecting to a PostgreSQL database for storing, querying, and creating information about artists and venues on Fyyur.

### Overview

Using a PostgreSQL database, this app is capable of:

* creating new venues, artists, and creating new shows.
* searching for venues and artists.
* learning more about a specific artist or venue.

### Tech Stack

Our tech stack includes:

* **SQLAlchemy ORM** to be our ORM library of choice
* **PostgreSQL** as our database of choice
* **Python3** and **Flask** as our server language and server framework
* **Flask-Migrate** for creating and running schema migrations
* **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Javascript** with [Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/customize/) for our website's frontend

### Main Files: Project Structure

  ```sh
  ├── README.md
  ├── app.py *** the main driver of the app. Includes your SQLAlchemy models.
                    "python app.py" to run after installing dependences
  ├── config.py *** Database URLs, CSRF generation, etc
  ├── error.log
  ├── forms.py *** Your forms
  ├── requirements.txt *** The dependencies we need to install with "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"
  ├── static
  │   ├── css 
  │   ├── font
  │   ├── ico

  │   └── js
  └── templates
      ├── errors
      ├── forms
      ├── layouts
      └── pages
  ```

Overall:
* Models are located in the `MODELS` section of `app.py`.
* Controllers are also located in `app.py`.
* The web frontend is located in `templates/`, which builds static assets deployed to the web server at `static/`.
* Web forms for creating data are located in `form.py`

Highlight folders:
* `templates/pages` -- Defines the pages that are rendered to the site. These templates render views based on data passed into the template’s view, in the controllers defined in `app.py`. These pages successfully represent the data to the user, and are already defined for you.
* `templates/layouts` -- Defines the layout that a page can be contained in to define footer and header code for a given page.
* `templates/forms` -- Defines the forms used to create new artists, shows, and venues.
* `app.py` -- Defines routes that match the user’s URL, and controllers which handle data and renders views to the user. This is the main file you will be working on to connect to and manipulate the database and render views with data to the user, based on the URL.
* Models in `app.py` -- Defines the data models that set up the database tables.
* `config.py` -- Stores configuration variables and instructions, separate from the main application code. This is where you will need to connect to the database.

### Development Setup

First, install Flask, Flask SQLalchemy and Flask-Migrate if you haven't already.

  ```
  $ cd ~
  $ pip install flask
  $ pip install flask-sqlalchemy
  $ pip install Flask-Migrate 
  ```

To start and run the local development server:

1. Clone this repo:
  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/nohasalama/fyyur_project.git
  ```

2. Initialize and activate a virtualenv:
  ```
  $ cd YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY_PATH/
  $ virtualenv env
  $ source env/bin/activate
  ```

3. Install the dependencies:
  ```
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

4. Create a new PostgreSQL database and change the database uri located in `config.py` accordingly to connect to the newly created local database server. The general form for a connection URI is: `postgresql://user:password@localhost:port/dbname`

5. Run migrations:
  ```
  $ flask db init # create a migrations repository
  $ flask db migrate # generate an initial migration
  $ flask db upgrade # apply the migration to the database
  ```

6. Run the development server:
  ```
  $ export FLASK_APP=myapp
  $ export FLASK_ENV=development # enables debug mode
  $ python3 app.py
  ```

7. Navigate to Home page [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## Authors

Noha Salama has implemented the models and the API endpoints in `app.py`, and this README.
The rest of the project files, including the templates, were created by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) as a project base code for project 1 for the [Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0044).
